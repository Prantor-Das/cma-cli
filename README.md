A simple and powerful CLI tool to scaffold a modern MERN stack application with a single command. Stop wasting time on boilerplate and focus on your code.

## Why cma-cli?

`cma-cli` provides a production-ready MERN stack template with a clean and organized structure, essential developer tooling, and a great developer experience out of the box.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI:** An easy-to-use command-line interface to get you started in seconds.
- **Flexible Initialization:** Choose to initialize client-only, server-only, or both parts of your MERN stack.
- **JavaScript & TypeScript:** Choose between a JavaScript or a TypeScript template with full type safety.
- **Modern Stack:** React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with the latest best practices.
- **Multiple Package Managers:** Support for bun, pnpm, yarn, and npm with intelligent detection and fallback.
- **Vite Powered:** A fast and modern build tool for the frontend with hot reload.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** A utility-first CSS framework with built-in dark mode support.
- **Git Integration:** Automatic Git repository initialization with GitHub integration.
- **Concurrent Development:** Optional setup to run both client and server simultaneously.
- **Production Ready:** Security middleware, error handling, and optimization out of the box.

## Installation  

You can install **`cma-cli`** either locally or globally.  

### 1. Local Installation and Usage
Run the following command:  
```bash
npx cma-cli
```

### 2. Global Installation and Usage 
First, install the CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g cma-cli
```

Once installed, you can create a new MERN stack application anywhere by running:

```bash
cma-cli
```

The CLI will then prompt you with a few questions to configure your project:

1.  **Project Name:** The name of your project (use "./" for current directory).
2.  **Language:** Choose between JavaScript and TypeScript.
3.  **Package Manager:** Select from bun, pnpm, yarn, or npm (automatically detects available options).
4.  **Initialize Parts:** Choose to initialize client-only, server-only, or both parts.
5.  **Concurrently:** Set up scripts to run both client and server simultaneously (when both parts are selected).
6.  **Install Dependencies:** Automatically install all dependencies.
7.  **Initialize Git:** Initialize a new git repository with optional GitHub integration.

After the setup is complete, you can navigate to your new project and start the development server.

## Templates & Initialization Options

`cma-cli` provides flexible templates with multiple initialization options:

### Language Templates
- **JavaScript:** A complete MERN stack template using JavaScript.
- **TypeScript:** A fully type-safe MERN stack template with strict TypeScript configuration.

### Initialization Options
- **Full Stack (Both):** Complete MERN stack with both client and server in separate directories.
- **Client Only:** React frontend with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and routing (no backend).
- **Server Only:** Express backend with MongoDB, security middleware, and API structure (no frontend).

### Package Manager Support
